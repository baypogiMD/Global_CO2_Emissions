# Global CO₂ Emissions: Long-Term Trend Analysis (1750–2020)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository analyzes historical global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from 1750 to 2020.
The objective is to understand long-term emission trends, growth dynamics, and structural
shifts associated with industrialization and modern economic expansion.

The project uses:
- **SQL** for data modeling and analytical queries
- **Python (Jupyter notebooks)** for visualization, statistical analysis, and forecasting

## 🔍 Key Questions Addressed
- When did global emissions begin accelerating?
- Is emissions growth linear or exponential?
- Are there detectable structural breaks?
- What do business-as-usual forecasts imply?
